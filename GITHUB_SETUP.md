# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## 🚀 Upload Your GNN Project to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in with your account (`deepskilling`)
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Repository settings:
   - **Repository name**: `university-gnn-demo` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `Educational Graph Neural Network implementation for university course recommendations using pure NumPy`
   - **Visibility**: Public ✅ (to share with others)
   - **Initialize with README**: ❌ No (we already have one)
   - **Add .gitignore**: ❌ No (we created one)
   - **Choose a license**: MIT License ✅ (optional but recommended)

### Step 2: Prepare Your Local Repository
Open Terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd "/Users/rchandran/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-DiligentCorporation/RESEARCH/GNN"

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: University GNN with course recommendations

- Complete Graph Convolutional Network implementation in pure NumPy
- University dataset with 100 students, 25 courses, 12 professors
- Link prediction for course recommendations
- Step-by-step educational walkthrough
- Performance analysis and visualization"

# Add remote repository (replace YOUR_USERNAME and REPO_NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/deepskilling/university-gnn-demo.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Security Recommendation
**⚠️ Important**: Instead of using your password, use a Personal Access Token:

1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: "GNN Project Upload"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy and save the token** - you'll use this instead of your password

When prompted for password during `git push`, use the **token** instead.

### Step 4: Verify Upload
After pushing, visit your repository at:
`https://github.com/deepskilling/university-gnn-demo`

You should see all your files with the README displayed.
